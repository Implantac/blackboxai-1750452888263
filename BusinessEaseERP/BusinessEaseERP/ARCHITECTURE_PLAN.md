# USE WEB ERP - System Architecture Plan

## 1. Architecture Style

- **Modular Monolith** architecture is chosen for the initial implementation.
- Justification:
  - Scalability: Modular monolith allows clear separation of concerns and modules, enabling easier scaling of individual modules later.
  - Maintenance: Easier to maintain and develop with a single codebase initially, reducing complexity.
  - Response Time: Direct in-process communication between modules ensures low latency.
- Future-proof: The architecture allows gradual migration to microservices if needed.

## 2. Technology Stack

- Frontend: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for UI.
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js framework.
- Database: PostgreSQL relational database.
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Security: AES encryption for sensitive data, LGPD compliance.

## 3. Database Structure

- Centralized PostgreSQL database with schemas for each module.
- Core tables:
  - Users, Roles, Permissions
  - Customers, Leads, Opportunities, Contracts (Sales & CRM)
  - Products, Inventory, Suppliers (Inventory & Supply)
  - Sales Orders, Payments, POS Transactions
  - Financial Transactions, Bank Reconciliation
  - Production Orders, Materials, Costs
  - Fixed Assets, Depreciation, Maintenance Logs
  - Tax Documents (NFe, NFCe, CTe, MDFe)
- Relationships enforced with foreign keys and indexes for performance.

## 4. Module Interaction

- Modules communicate via RESTful APIs within the monolith.
- Shared services for authentication, logging, and notifications.
- Event-driven architecture for asynchronous tasks (e.g., tax document generation, AI predictions).
- API gateway layer to expose external APIs for third-party integrations.

## 5. Compliance and Localization

- All modules implement Brazilian tax and legal rules.
- Currency in Brazilian Real (R$).
- Language: Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) for UI and messages.

This architecture plan will guide the development of the ERP system.

Next, I will prepare the detailed implementation plan for the modules.
